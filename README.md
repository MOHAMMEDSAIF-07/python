 >Go through this repository to learn the basic's of "PYTHON" programming
# 
# 
# What is Python?
 >Python is a interpreted, high level, general purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991.
>
 >It is free and open source, runs on all major operating systems,like - Windows,Linux and Macos.
>
 >Python is designed to be highly extensible and does not have all of its functionalities built into its core.
# 
# 
# Python Features
 >Python syntax is easy to learn and code, developer friendly and is high-level programming language.
>
 >It has effective data-handling mechanism and excellent storage facilitiy for numerical as well as textual data.
>
 >It has dynamic and automatic memory management.
>
 >It has large and integrated collection of tools for data manipulation, analysis and processing.
>
 >It is case sensitive programming language.
# 
# 
# Why Python
 >Easy to use and learn - minimalistic language
>
 >Programs are smaller, simpler and flexible
>
 >Powerfull libraries
>
 >Dynamically typed ( Language determines the type of a variable at runtime, rather than when the program is compiled )
# 
# 
# Variables
 >A python identifier is a name that is used to identify variables, functions or any other user-defined item. It must follow naming rules.
>
 >It can compose of letters (A-Z) (a-z), digits (0-9) or the underscore (_) character.
>
 >Python does not allow punctuation characters such as @,$ and % within identifiers.
>
 >Reserved words have pre-defined significance in python, hence these cannot be used as constants or any other identifier name. Ex: if, else, for, break, etc.
# 
# 
# Comments:
 >They are helping text that makes the code more readable, and are ignored by compiler.
>
 >A single line comment starts with a ‘#’
>
 >Multi-line comments start and end with triple quotes (“””)
# 
# 
# print() function:
 >The output can be displayed using a print() function.
>
 >Ex:
>
 >salary = 7000
>
 >print(“Total salary is salary”)				--> Total salary is salary
>
>print(“total salary is : ”,salary)				--> total salary is : 7000
# 
# 
# Input() function: 
 >This function is primarily used to take input from the user.
>
 >This function accepts only string data.
# Ex:
 >num=input(“Enter the number: “)
>
 >print(“The number is : “,num, “and the class is : “,type(num))
>
 >output:
>
 >Enter the number: 12345
>
 >The number is : 12345 and the class is : <class ‘str’>
# 
# 
# Operators
 >
 > A operator is a symbol that tells the computer to perform specific mathematical or logical function.
# Python provides
 >Arithmetic operators	+,-,*,/,%,**,//
>
 >Assignment		=,+=,-=,*=,/=
>
 >Relational		==,!=,<,>,<=,>=
>
 >Logical		&&,||,^
>
 >Boolean		0/1
